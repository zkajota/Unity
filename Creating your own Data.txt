The following can be created:

NPCs
Actions
Needs

All of them are in the Assets/Data folder, in corresponding folders.
You can check example files to see how they are structured.

NPCs are loaded in automatically, but require appropriate spawn points placed in the scene.

In order to add a new node, copy an existing one. Name does not matter, but it needs to be an area child object.

Each node has ActionObjectScript. It holds the NAME of an action that can be performed there.
For example, "Food" means that "Food action is performed in this spot.

Each Action holds the following:
Name - used for identification
ImageName - used for queueing image
forNeed - which need this action fulfills
Color - what colour the NPC becomes when doing the action.


Example of implementing a new "eatBurger" action, which fills food need.


1) Create new action file
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-2"?>
<ActionClass xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <name>EatBurger</name>
  <imageName>Burger</imageName>
  <forNeed>Food</forNeed>
  <color>
    <r>0</r>
    <g>1</g>
    <b>0</b>
    <a>1</a>
  </color>
</ActionClass>

2) Edit the test scene
2.1 Copy the FoodObject in "Area"
2.2 Change ActionObjectScript "Name" to "EatBurger"
